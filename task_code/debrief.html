		<h3>What are we trying to learn from this research?</h3>
		<p>The decoy effect is a psychological phenemenon that describes the change in preference between two options (a 'target' and 'competitor') when a third option (a 'decoy') is introduced. This decoy is similar, but inferior, to the target. Even though the decoy option is useless, its presence increases the preference for the target. We hope to replicate previous findings and show that the inclusion of a decoy option changes people's preferences within a gambling context.</p>

		<h3>Why is this important to scientists or the general public?</h3>
		<p>These questions are of importance to further our understanding of how the decoy effect impact our decisions. We hope to expand our understanding of how the decoy effect influences decision making.</p>
		
		<h3>What are our hypotheses and predictions?</h3>
		<p>We expect to replicate previous findings that a decoy will affect a participant's choice between two equivalent alternatives within a gambling context. Specificially, people will be more inclined to select the target gamble when the decoy option is present.</p>
